    "So, boundary samples can be computed in this algorithm. However, the aim of attribute reducion is to find feature subset which can distinguish the samples. It is different from discovering boundary samples. To support separating hyper-plane, one requires a set of boundary samples with an appropriate size. Too few boundary samples are not enough to support the optimal hyper-plane. Therefore, on one hand, we should delete most of the samples in the positive region; on the other hand, we should keep enough samples near the decision boundary to support the optimal hyper-plane. The value of δ depends on applications. Generally speaking, if the inter-class distance of a learning sample set is large, we should assign δ with a\n",

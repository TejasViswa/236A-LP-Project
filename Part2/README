Hi! This folder has the scripts for Part II of the project.
Please note that we have implemented the ILP using numpy, instead of using cvxpy. The details of our ILP formulation can be found in the report submitted.


Script details
==============
a) classifier_Part2.py: Implementation of all the functions. The function ILP() in this script is our ILP implementation. As stated before, we have not used cvxpy to formulate this LP problem, instead we have used numpy.
b) GaussianGen.py: Script to generate the synthetic dataset samples.
c) main_part2.py: The top level script tobe run.

Executing the script
====================
Parameters to be set in main_part2.py
a) DatasetToBeUsed: "mnist" or "Gaussian" 
b) class1 and class2: Labels that you want to classify. In case of Gaussian, please set "class1" to 1 and "class2" to -1.
c) lambd: Value of the regulariation parameter.
d) mean1, mean2, cov1, and cov2: Mean and Covariance matrix values. This is if using Gaussian dataset.
e) NoOfSamples: Number of samples to be generated per (mean1,cov1) and (mean2, cov2) combination. This is if using Gaussian dataset.
f) FracOfTest: Fraction of (mean1,cov1) and (mean2, cov2) to be set aside as test set.
g) "dataset" and "test_dataset": Update paths as per your folder structure.

Running script:
python main_part2.py
